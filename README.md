Feel free to use anything from this repo. This app has a pretty close adhesion to AWS. So if you want it to work with other service providers, or you want it to work locally, you might need to do some extra work.


Other than that, I hope you guys have fun playing with Chat_GPT. The project might be further developed depending on the new features of future Chat_GPT updates.

Cheers,
